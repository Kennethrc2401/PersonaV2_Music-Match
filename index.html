    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Micheal is a motivational music instructor. He sometimes has a very busy schedule but does his best to put a lot of time into motivating people into wanting to learn about music.
    <br />
    <br />
He charges $70 per hour for music lessons. He wants to be matched with beginner students who are ready to put in at least 10 hours of practice per week. The commissions charged by the site have to be relatively small and the benefits of scheduling through the site must be considerable, otherwise he will just tell his students to pay him directly.
